# News Hub

News Hub is a website created in a Reddit style blog format to allow users to view and create posts for others to read, comment and like on.

The site is fully responsive and designed in a simplistic and easy to navigate manner. It has been coded using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django and the Bootstrap frameworks.

# Agile Planning Environment

## MosCow Method

Using GitHub's useful project board I could ensure that I followed the MosCow method to justify each of my actions through the project. This helped keep good structure during the project development process.

As I was creating a blog style project the User Stories were taking from a previous walkthrough project.

Here is a screenshot of the environment

# Design

## NewsHub Design

The design was made to be clean and easy to navigate and view. Keeping the colour scheme simple and consistent across the site. Areas of importance stand out by using a strong blue colour to highlight them, where areas of less focus are kept simple and clean using pale colours.
